## Description

This project is based on the Scala "Bioinformatics Algorithms" of 
Jason Mar,
https://github.com/jasonmar/bioinformatics-algorithms
that has good implementations in Scala,
for the algorithms of the excellent book of Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner,
"Bioinformatics Algorithms: An active learning approach".

You can get the print version of the book at http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com


The current project aims to extend that work and make it better usable as a
ScalaLab toolbox. The jar file of the toolbox exist pre-build at the "defaultToolboxes" folder.

This project is organized into packages named for chapters of the source textbook.


## Motivation

Bioinformatics algorithms offer many chances to demonstrate 
how standard Scala collections can be used to implement algorithms 
in a concise and hopefully easy to understand way that often closely matches the documentation.

The implementations of Jason Mar are excellent,
and demonstrate the potential of the Scala language for  concise and elegant solutions.

The present project aims to extend that work,
to provide more examples that can be used more easily from within the ScalaLab environment, 
and to experiment with efficient approaches for handling large next generation 
sequencing data sets.
